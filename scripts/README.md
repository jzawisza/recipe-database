# recipe-database
The `v1` directory contains the current version of my recipe database application, written in PHP and using a MySQL database.

The `client` directory contains preliminary React code for a UI mockup of the next version of the application.  The `server` directory contains preliminary backend code, implemented with [Feathers](https://feathersjs.com/) and [Sequelize](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/).
